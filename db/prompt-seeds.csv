how does the color yellow make you feel
the last time you walked leisurely in the rain
the last time you laughed until it hurt
that time you accidentally fell in love
jumping in puddles
when wind blows the leaves in a circle
the best meal you ever had
what would you tell your 13 year old self
hurt break feels like…
your favorite curse word
What would be your super power
The best day you ever had
What makes you cringe
When you dance alone in the mirror
How do you feel when you have laughing gas at the dentist
The person that makes you smile most
What makes a good sandwich
What do u long for
The stupidest thing you said today
What could you eat everyday
Run or swim?
A crime that you’re likely to commit
A color that you hate
Something you wish you knew this morning
The thing that lights you up
Best gift you’ve ever given
A song you always sing to yourself
Most memorable dream
A really funny word
Your first friend
What music is playing in your head
You are wearing your most comfy pajamas
